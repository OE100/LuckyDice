# Lucky Dice
This mod adds a bunch of different dice, each with it's own event pool.
When a dice is used (left mouse) it "rolls" an event from it's pool.

# Todo:
- Guide on extending the event/item system of the mod (the api is already in there, just needs documentation)
- Write what each event does

# Releases

# Version 0.0.1
- Early Beta
- Added extendable dice items (with regular solids already implemented)
- Added extendable event system (with some base event types and events already implemented)
